    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Thick slices of tomato and mozzarella flavored with fresh basil leaves, 
        olive oil, and a beautiful balsamic reduction: It's is so simple, but oh so impressive. 
        Caprese salad makes a scrumptious quick lunch at home, or you can serve it with grilled steak kabobs for an 
        easy summer dinner! It's just as perfect for a full blown Italian-inspired feast with spaghetti and meatballs 
        and garlic cheese bread. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 c. balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>3 ripe tomatoes, sliced thick</li>
        <li>12 oz. fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced thick</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small saucepan, bring the balsamic vinegar to a boil over medium-low heat. Cook until the balsamic has reduced to a thicker glaze, 10 to 20 minutes. Remove it from the heat and transfer to a bowl or cruet. Allow to cool.</li>
        <li>When you're ready to serve, arrange tomato and mozzarella slices on a platter. Arrange basil leaves between the slices. Drizzle olive oil over the top of the salad, getting a little bit on each slice. Do the same with the balsamic reduction, making designs if you want. Store extra balsamic reduction in fridge for a later use.</li>
        <li>End with a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Serve as a lunch, with crusty bread, or serve alongside a beef main course for dinner.</li>
    </ol>
